##<a id='load-greenplum-to-minio'></a> Loading and Unloading Greenplum Data to a Minio Object Store

Greenplum database supports loading and unloading data from several types of external data sources, including objects stored in a Minio object store. Objects in a Minio object store can contain unstructured data, text files, log files, time series data, and Greenplum tables.

* Data previously stored in a Minio object store can be loaded into Greenplum.
* A developer can load data from Greenplum tables into a Minio object store for access by an external application.
* External applications can write data to a Minio object store which can then be loaded into Greenplum.
